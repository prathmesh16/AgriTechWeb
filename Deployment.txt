We need one server to manage the responces.So The account is created account on https://in.000webhost.com/

Using this 000webhost server the responces are managed.

We created a new website and strorage for our website on 000webhost.

Then we uploded the files of our website and required resouces like images,videos .etc on the cloud service of 000webhost to make it globally accessible.

We took a domain name from a site named freenom.

And the domain name is parked on to the name of our 000webhost website.

Using that Domain we made our site globally accessible.Which can be accessed by browser from anywhere.
